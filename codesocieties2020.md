## Code Societies Website & Blog: [sfpc.io/code-societies](http://sfpc.io/code-societies)
- Three-Week Session, Monday January 6th - Saturday January 25th 2020
- SFPC, 155 Bank Street, West Village, NYC
- 6:30pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes
- **Applications are closed**


School for Poetic Computation(SFPC)’s winter intensive is an introduction to re-introducing yourselves to computers. How do different platforms and processes—including algorithms, surveillance, social media, infrastructure, and interface—yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, feeling, and reinforce existing systems of power? We will examine how code and societies shape and are shaped by each other by building new codes made of the the digital, the social, and the ritual, on a foundation of shared experience and a commitment to learning with care together. Code Societies is about redrawing the divisions that make us and unmake us. We’ll begin by challenging the division between those who code software and those who are coded by it.

No coding experience necessary: This session centers the learning experience of beginner programmers.  We will argue that everyone who interacts with computers has—in important ways—always already been programming them.[^1]

Through a balanced, interwoven study of critical theory and hands-on coding workshops, students will develop several small scores or sketch pieces online, on screens, performed, or installed. We’ll cover foundational methods of coding with Python, coding on the web, navigating the command line, and working with zines as a technology. The classes are held in the evenings and are designed to engage with code, and the ways code acts on our bodies and networks, equally as subject and as medium. Code Societies is an invitation to use code to choreograph new ways of being with each other within the unique learning environment of SFPC.

We will work together to create boundaries that make it easier for everyone involved to feel as safe and comfortable as possible throughout the session. SFPC is a school organized by people who are committed to making space for people who exist at the intersections of oppressed identities, including but not limited to, those who are queer, trans, people of color, disabled, deaf, or hard of hearing. Code Societies studies the very systems that create barriers to technology and learning. The process of ideological confrontation can sometimes feel uncomfortable. We understand safety is relative and in constant negotiation. We also distinguish safety from discomfort, as there is no such thing as a never uncomfortable space.[^2] Read more about the SFPC code of conduct [here](https://github.com/SFPC/codeofconduct).

### Student Quotes

**Check out Emma Norton's Student Showcase project from Code Societies 2019,<br>[A Collaborative Archive of Code Societies Ephemera](https://sfpc.io/codesocieties_students/)**

>“This experience was comparable to reading a book that jars me ideologically, changes my conception of possibility, and gives me a new framework for approaching the experience of being a person with a body in a place.” - Mimi Doan after FlucT’s class during Code Societies 2019

>“For me Code Societies was an entanglement of ideas, movement and metaphor […] we listened to each other, moved our bodies through space, and shared with each other ways of seeing the world and ourselves.” - Emma Rae Norton from their project, A collaborative Archive of Code Societies Ephemera, 2019


### What will happen in these three weeks?
Classes are held in the evenings Monday-Friday from 6:30-9:30pm with a day off on Martin Luther King Day January 21st. SFPC space will be open for students on weekdays between 3:30pm-6pm. The session will culminate in a party on the evening of Saturday January 25th, where students can invite their friends and present their projects and reflections.

Students will have full access to the space during open hours for the three weeks of the session to work on projects between classes and mentors will be readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance.


### How do I apply?
**Applications are now closed**<br>

We accept up to 18 students on a rolling basis until **Monday, December 1st**. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early! We will respond to your application within 3 weeks of submission.

### How competitive is the admissions?

SFPC admissions is highly competitive. Every session, we receive up to 80 applicants and select 18. We focus on creating diversity among our student body. We work with a group of alumni and teachers to review and select students based on their work samples and essays.

### How much is tuition?
$3,000 USD for the 3-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $800 - $1400). Upon acceptance, payment of full tuition, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible.

### Do you offer scholarship?

**UPDATE:** SFPC Code Societies is offering a fully subsidized work-study position for Black, Brown and Indigenous people of color; those who are low income and/or underrepresented in art/tech/academia. 
Thanks to a generous donation from [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/). 

We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. In Code Societies, we are offering three work-study opportunity to a qualified applicant who would be expected to work 5 hrs/week in exchange for a 50% reduction of tuition.  We’re particularly looking out for women, people of color, disabled person, people under-represented in the field of art + technology, and those with financial need.

Please note that if you apply for work study, we will consider your application separately from the general admissions applications, since we have little flexibility regarding scholarships. This is for people who absolutely need assistance to participate in SFPC. Occasionally, students have received support from cultural foundations, schools or current employers and we are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance.

### Cancellation and refund policy

- If you are accepted and need to cancel, we can give you 100% refund up to December 15th, 2019.
- 50% refund between December 15th – December 25th, 2020.
- 25% refund between December 25th – January 3rd, 2020.
- No refunds can be given after January 3rd, 2020.
- Participation is not transferrable to another person.


### What is expected of me?

- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)
