            <p>School for Poetic Computation (SFPC) is an artist run school in New York that was founded in 2013. A small group of students and faculty work closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory — focusing especially on artistic intervention. It’s a hybrid of a school, residency and research group.</p>
            <p>Our motto is more poetry, less demo.</p>

            <p>This year’s showcase theme is “Society for Power Control.”</p>
            <p>Engaged in an ongoing exploration of code, hardware and theory, students will present their work in progress, ideas and questions in an open studio environment. SFPC’s motto is “More Poetry, Less Demo!” and we invite the audience to participate, enjoy unexpected surprises and be inspired to start new collaborations.</p>
            <p>“Society for Power Control” is a critical reflection of technology and speculative exploration of the future. How can technology empower or constrain, clarify or obfuscate individuals and society? “Power Control” is that space between “poetic” and “computation.”</p>

            <p>Hélène Martin is an artist filmmaker living in London. She studied at the Royal College of Art (MA Printmaking and Mphil Fine Art Research by practice in 2010). She exhibited both nationally and internationally, Camden Art Centre (UK), New Shelter Plan (DK), Photographic Centre (DK). She is a member of the artist-run film lab Filmwerkplaats, Rotterdam. She is enthused by the Re-Engineering Moving Image (REMI) program, a cooperation between Mire (Nantes, Fr), LaborBerlin (Berlin, DE) and Filmwerkplaats (Rotterdam, NL), “focused on the creation, preservation and circulation of technical knowledge of analogue film in order to support its use as a creative medium”. In that respect, she is interested in the novel approaches to re-apply “obsolete” media in the field of digitalisation and vice-versa, as both media can coexist and serve a narrative structure in new and interesting ways. Ada Lovelace described her approach as “poetical science” and perhaps it is the way she envisages filming and programming.</p>

She uses technology and computation to play with systems that underlie contemporary society. She is interested in taking art out of the museum and into the processes of everyday life. Her previous work explored our relationship to technology and science by taking scientific processes and the aesthetics of the experiment as raw material. She studied sculpture, metalworking, and photography at Pratt institute and is currently a masters candidate at ITP. Her work has been featured on Radiolab, the Discovery Channel, and exhibited in galleries internationally.</p>
